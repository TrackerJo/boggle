Word List JS >> v0.2 >> tools

This is the README for the .NET tool to convert the English Open Word List (http://dreamsteep.com/projects/the-english-open-word-list.html) single-letter CSV file into a JS file. This is to allow updates later outside of the main code file as needed. NOTE: Updates are unlikely to be needed. I am simply including this .NET project since I used it to put the EOWL CSVs into JS files, and someone may find it useful.

Simply alter the code to point to where the CSV is, and where you want the file to end up. Then run the console application, enter the letter of the CSV file you are running, and that is it!
